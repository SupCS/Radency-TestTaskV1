# Kanban board
The Kanban Board is a web application designed for task and project management, enabling users to organize their work to enhance efficiency and productivity. Utilizing the Kanban methodology, the application offers a visual representation of tasks, their due dates, priorities. Features include the creation of various lists to categorize tasks or stages of completion, management of tasks with the ability to add, edit, and move them between lists while setting deadlines and priorities, and an integrated activity history to track changes and actions. The project employs React.js for an interactive user interface, ReduxToolkit for state management, NestJS for server-side processing, API requests, authentication, and database interactions, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Docker for containerization and simplified deployment.

## Start working

docker-compose up --build

You will get an empty database, so feel free to create your lists and tasks from scratch!

Start locally:

cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev

cd ../frontend
